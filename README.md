# DotFiles

This repository contains the configuration files that I use in macOS, it's managed using chezmoi and some simple custom scripts, all of the private information and keys that are typically stored in this files. Those are stored in 1Password using the integration provided by chezmoi.

It contains configurations for:
- NeoVim
- iTerm2
- tmux
- Alacritty
- Zed
- LinearMouse
- Git
- ZsH using Oh-My-ZsH
- Brew
- macOS custom settings
- In the future maybe more??
